question: Iterate through the list and print out the information of the
media by using toString() method. Observe
what happens and explain in detail.
- each type of media will have different toString() output, as it overrides
the toString method from parent abstract class (Media), while the
parent class itself also overrides the original toString() method.


question: If the passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens?
- the method returns false.


question: Suppose we are taking this Comparable interface approach.

1. What class should implement the Comparable interface?
- class Media, as this class has to compare its instances.

2. In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo() method
be to reflect the ordering that we want?
- use compareTo() to first compare the title of the two objects, if it doesnt return 0
then compare the cost.

3. Can we have two ordering rules of the item 
by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this
Comparable interface approach?
- No. compareTo() can only be overriden once.

4.  Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule
from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing
length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
- in the compare() method of the 2 comparator, check the object is
instanceof DVD first, then customize the comparison strategy.
